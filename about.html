					<h3 id="preeducation">Pre-education</h3>
					<p>It all began in a little interest in understanding how my family's computer worked. The Internet was a scary place for small me then; I spent most of my time exploring it and seeing how it worked.</p>

					<h3 id="earlyeducation">Early education</h3>
					<p>When joining pre-school, I had so much to learn and share. I was the (not so small) kid who always gets excited at the introduction of new technology.</p>

					<h3 id="primaryschool">Primary school</h3>
					<p>Every trip to the computer lab seemed like paradise to me, and it didn't take long before I managed to gain weekly access to the lab by joining the school's ICT Club.</p>
					<p>Thanks to my experience in the early days, I blazed through content fast and managed to pick up things efficiently. Block coding was fun, too.</p>

					<h3 id="secondaryschool">Secondary school</h3>
					<p>If you were to ask me if secondary school was the most impactful time of my life, I'd say so.</p>
					<p>Since joining secondary school, a whole lot of new experiences exposed me to have hands-on experience with code.</p>
					<p>Most of my skills come from here‚ÄîI've participated in programmes, joined hackathons, and met so many friends who share the same and more elaborate dreams as I do.</p>

					<h2>Thinking and learning my way.</h2>
					<p class="major">Over the years, I've adapted five constant but interdependent values‚ÄîI like to call them my 'core values'.</p>	
					<p>Even though there may be slight additions or variations, the concept behind each value is never lost.</p>
					<div id="menu">
						<ul>
							<a href="#care" class="button small smooth-scroll-middle">Care</a>

					<h3 id="care">üíû Care</h3>
					<blockquote>(noun) Serious attention or consideration applied to doing something correctly or to avoid damage or risk.</blockquote>
					<p>Even though the dictionary definition specifies 'damage' and 'risk', I don't only care for tasks or handling work. Caring for people is equally, if not more, important than that; therefore, there are a few things that I substantially care for:</p>
					<h4>Care for others.</h4>
					<p>A definite top priority, caring for others is the most important of the 'care' factor‚Äîsimply, you can't establish a good friendship without caring. To me, caring means more than just talking; it's about taking the next step that shatters barriers between what a friend can do.</p>
					<h4>Care for work and responsibilities.</h4>
					<p>Up next, I prioritise caring for work and responsibilities to make sure that I handle all my tasks effectively, efficiently, and successfully.</p>
					<h4>Care for self.</h4>
					<p>You can't establish most of caring if you don't care for yourself. That's why I also take up the challenge to continue caring for myself; inspiring and motivating through rough moments to keep myself optimistic.</p>

					<h3 id="respect">ü§ù Respect</h3>
					<blockquote>(noun) Due regard for the feelings, wishes, or rights of.</blockquote>
					<p>In all my school experience, respect has been the value that's been the hardest to show. It often lacks in many nowadays, and many also tend to misinterpret respect. However, I've focused on several aspects:</p>
					<h4>Respect for others.</h4>
					<p>Respect is also a chain that establishes and sustains relationships. By showing respect, you acknowledge someone else's identity, voice, and opinion.</p>
					<h4>Respect for opinions.</h4>
					<p>Not everyone will have the same opinion as me. I won't disregard anyone just for having conflicting views. No exceptions.</p>

					<h3 id="responsibility">üóÇ Responsibility</h3>
					<blockquote>(noun) Liable to be required to give account, as of one's actions or of the discharge of a duty or trust.</blockquote>
					<p>Responsibility is a task that many seem to struggle with‚Äîeven I do at times. However, I can't and won't let stressful moments break me from being responsible for tasks; be it homework or projects, I try my best to persevere and fulfil the responsibility provided to me.</p>

					<h3 id="perseverance">üí™ Perseverance</h3>
					<blockquote>(noun) Persistence in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success.</blockquote>
					<p>I don't put down quickly when stress comes in. Having a robust mental filter, I tend to find positives among negative situations to make myself gear up and prepare for the bad better.</p>
					<p>I also utilise methods of reflection to make sure that I internalise, process, and understand why things happen the way they do‚Äîand what I can do moving forward.</p>

					<h3 id="integrity">üß† Integrity</h3>
					<blockquote>(noun) The quality of being honest and having strong moral principles OR the state of being whole and undivided.</blockquote>
					<p>I find the definition of integrity interesting; that's why I've decided to take in both definitions and compartmentalise them through different segments:</p>
					<h4>Mental integrity.</h4>
					<p>We are in an age where it has never been so easy to break down from stress, pressure, and hardships. I've learnt the importance of establishing mental integrity, to make sure that I don't break when reaching rock bottom.</p>
					<h4>Emotional integrity.</h4>
					<p>I try my best to be as honest as I can when sharing feelings or emotions.</p>
					<h4>Opinion integrity.</h4>
					<p>I try to have an opinion and remain honest about it as much as possible.</p>

					<h2>Interest</h2>
					<p>I've been so passionate and interested in tech for a long time, dating back to <a href="#preeducation" class="smooth-scroll-middle">before education.</a></p>
					<ul>
						<li>I've had fun exploring computers before education.</li>
						<li>During my early days in school, I used to spend a lot of breaks on computers.</li>
						<li>Starting primary school, I solidify to take my passion through joining the ICT Club.</li>
						<li>Secondary school gave me everything I need to get started, and I'm very grateful for it.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Core values</h2>
					<p>These core values help me operate everyday, even if the impact is small.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Care</b> keeps me in check; I try to care for others, care for work and responsibilities, and care for myself.</li>
						<li><b>Respect</b> makes sure that I continue to establish good relationships; I try to show respect for others and respect for opinions.</li>
						<li><b>Responsibility</b> holds me accountable for all my work; I try to keep them on track.</li>
						<li><b>Perseverance</b> makes me push against the tides when the table turns against me.</li>
						<li><b>Integrity</b> provides me with ways to cope and upholds my moral compass.</li>
